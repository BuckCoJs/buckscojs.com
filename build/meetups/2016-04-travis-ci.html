Join us at 6:30pm for
networking, talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff. For this month we have a
special guest <strong>Kyle Tyacke</strong> giving a talk about TravisCI.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration for Open Source Projects with Travis CI</strong></p>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) can save you time, reduce the hassles of managing
open source projects, improve the overall quality of your code, and make
merging a joy. But it can be a bit difficult to understand at first and a chore
to setup and manage.</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll break down the concepts of Continuous Integration, and take
a look at Travis CI, a free, hosted solution that makes it extremely easy to
add continuous integration to your open source projects. Once we have a handle
on the basics, we’ll move on to more advanced topics including sending build
notifications, running unit tests, linting, and automatically deploying
successful builds. While the example project used in this presentation will be
written in Node, the concepts discussed, as well as Travis CI itself, can be
applied to almost any language, bringing value to developers from all
backgrounds. Come learn how to make managing your open source projects fun
again, with continuous integration and Travis CI!</p>
