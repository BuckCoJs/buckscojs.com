<p>We have our February meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for networking,
talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff. For this month we have one of our
members, <strong>Frank Zammetti</strong> giving a talk about ExtJS.</p>
<p><strong>ExtJS: An introduction (and then some!)</strong></p>
<p>Choosing a library/toolkit for your next project from among the seemingly
thousands that are available is a tall order for any architect/developer.
Whether to choose one all-encompassing package or go the microlibrary approach
is a key question and it becomes even more difficult when the goal is to create
a powerful SPA that looks, feels and functions like a proper native desktop
application does.</p>
<p>If you prefer the monolithic approach then ExtJS is often a great choice. A
commercial (also with a F/OSS option) tool that has evolved over many years,
ExtJS provides everything a modern JS developer needs, from one of the most
robust set of widgets available to a powerful data handling subsystem, all the
usual utility-type functions you could ever need and even an optional back-end
system.</p>
<p>In this talk, you&#39;ll get an introductory-level look at what ExtJS can do.
You&#39;ll see some examples of various use cases from the simple (dropping some
ExtJS widgets in an existing project) to the complex (a full-fledged
application with many capabilities rivaling a native application). You&#39;ll get
an overview of the vast array of capabilities ExtJS provides and see plenty of
live code examples so you can get a good feel for how it all works. You&#39;ll hear
about the pros and cons of ExtJS so that you can make an informed decision
about using it and you&#39;ll hear about real-world experience, both good and bad,
of using it to produce applications that are more complex than what is probably
typical.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
