Hi Everyone! We have our August meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for
networking, pizza, drinks, etc. Talks starts at 7. This month we're going to
try something a little different and host a round of lightning talks.  Each
talk will average around 10-15 minutes (some longer, some shorter) so we can
cover a wide range of topics and skill levels.  Have an idea for a talk? Let us
know! (It's not too late.)

Talks currently include:
- __Localization & Internationalization__, by Jim Fitzpatrick
- __Ditching jQuery__, by Brett Erpel
- __Service Workers__, by Evan DiPietro
