Hi Everyone! We have our October meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for
networking, talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff (pizza, drinks, etc). This
month our own Jason Krol will be presenting:

__Building Set-Top-Box Apps Using AngularJS__

As more and more people cut the cord and drop their cable subscriptions, they
are turning to the various alternatives that exist mainly in the form of
set-top-boxes and smart TVs.  Learn how to leverage your HTML and JavaScript
skills to build fully interactive "apps" that run on a number of devices using
the same codebase.
