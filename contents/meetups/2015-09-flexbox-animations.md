We're Back!

Hello Everyone and welcome back to another exciting round of Bucks County
Front-end. This month we have a bit of a theme going on with our talks, CSS.
You love it, you hate it, and you still can't figure out how to vertically
align a div.

We'll have two talks on the 3rd from 2 of my favorite people:

__A New Way to Display: Understanding Flexbox for the Web__ by Sam Provenza

The new flexbox layout mode will redefine how we do layouts in CSS. This talk
will give a brief overview of the basics of Flexbox and how and when you should
be using it. If you haven't tried Flexbox yet, this is a great TL;DR overview
for anyone who wants to improve their CSS game.

__Moving the Web__ by CF Grugan

Animating your website’s components can be easier than you may think. The
questions we’ll explore are; When should we, When shouldn’t we, and what can we
do to make sure that animations don’t get in the way of out site’s performance
or our user’s goal.

As usual, we'll meet around 6:30pm for mingling and pizza. Then talks start at
7pm.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can help in any way!

See You Soon!

Ben
