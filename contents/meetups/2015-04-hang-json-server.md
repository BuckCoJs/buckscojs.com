Join us for our next meeting, April 6th.

We'll have two talks on the 6th, including:

__H.A.N.G__ - Creating static Sites with [Assemble.io](http://assemble.io/)

Assemble.io is a static site generator, much like Jekyll, but is build entirely
in the JS stack! During this talk Ben Spoon will talk through everything from
setup to production of your new static site.

__Faking APIs in 30 seconds__ - presentation will be longer than 30 seconds

In this talk, Jim Fitzpatrick will share ways to quickly mock out RESTful API
endpoints to facilitate rapid prototyping of user interfaces without the need
to delve into backend technologies.

Join us at 6:30pm for some general conversation, networking, and of course
refreshments (what would a meeting be without pizza and drinks, right?). Talks
will start at 7:00pm and conclude around 8:00pm.

See you there!
