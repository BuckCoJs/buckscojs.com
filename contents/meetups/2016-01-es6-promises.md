Hi Everyone -

The votes are in, and the winner for January's topic is __ES6 Promises__.
Thanks to all that voted. Our speaker will be __Jim Fitzpatrick__, and I will
send a synopsis of the talk later next week (after everything settles down from
vacations).

This will be our normal format, 6:30pm food and networking, 7pm we'll start the
talk, ~8pm we'll head over to Blue Dog to hang out. Hope to see you all after
the new year!
