Join us for our next meeting, Thursday May 7th.

__Web Components and Polymer__ - Jonathan Belcher gives us an in depth look at Web
Components, the standards they are built upon and the library developed to
enable their use.  We will look at, html imports, shadow DOM, custom elements
and templates and how they are used.  Discuss how they can be used today and
polyfills needed for browser support.  Overview the Polymer library and why it
enables easy use of Web Components.  Finally we will wrap up by demoing some
components built by the community.

__Open Mic!__ - Lets try something new and have an open mic where anyone can talk
about anything!  Think lightning talks, no slides, unrehearsed, have fun with
it!

Join us at 6:30pm for some general conversation, networking, and of course
refreshments (what would a meeting be without pizza and drinks, right?). Talks
will start at 7:00pm and conclude around 8:00pm.

See you there!
