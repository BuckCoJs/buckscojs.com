Hi Everyone We have our May meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for
networking, talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff. For this month we have our
very own __Jim Fitzpatrick__ talking about Functional Programming!

__Intro to Functional Style Programming in JS__

An introductory look at programming in a functional style in JavaScript. We’ll
use the Ramda utility library (akin to Underscore or Lodash) to learn about
function composition, currying, higher order functions, immutability and more
to build applications in a pure and principled way. Along the way, we’ll shape
some of the intuitions necessary for thinking about how data flows through the
programs we write while recognizing and taming side effects. Examples will be
applicable to both the server and client, with a particular spotlight on a
Redux-flavored React app.
