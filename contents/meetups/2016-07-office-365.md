Hi Everyone! We have our July meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for
networking and all the normal stuff (pizza, drinks, etc). Talk will officially
start at 7.  Presenting will be one of our members __Tim Ferro__ talking about
JS libraries for Office 365:

__Getting Started With JavaScript Libraries for Office 365__

Whether you are developing for Office 365 (or SharePoint on-premises), these
days you are going to need some “go-to” JavaScript libraries to enhance your
solutions. No matter what project I am on, over the past few years there are a
number of fantastic JavaScript libraries I have learned to use and integrate
with great success. They work with Apps, content editor web parts, .NET
solutions, and anywhere else you can utilize JavaScript (Even CSS!). Some of my
favorites covered in this session are jQuery, SPServices, jqPlot, and
DataTables.

In this session I will show how to get up and running developing with
JavaScript for Office 365 in multiple ways. Then I will demo some of my “go-to”
libraries as well as a few others. I will discuss real world application of
these libraries based on previous clients where I have used them. I will wrap
up with a nice combined demo that works great in both Office 365 and SharePoint
on-premises.
