Hi Everyone!

It's that time again, Bucks County Front-end Meetup time. This month we'll be
talking React/Flux with Jason Krol ([@ShortTompkins](https://twitter.com/ShortTompkins)),
author of Web Development with MongoDB and Node.js.

__Introduction to React.js__

React.js is the (somewhat) new kid on the block, but everyone seems to be
talking about it.  Lets take a brief introductory look at what React is (and
isn't), how to write some components, working with ES6 and JSX, and the ins and
outs of the component lifecycle. Finally we'll take a brief look at Flux and
get a better understanding of what it means.

Join us at 6:30pm for some networking and food, then we'll start the talks
around 7:00pm.

Looking forward to seeing you all on November 11th!
