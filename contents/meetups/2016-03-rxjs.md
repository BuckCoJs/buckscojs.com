Hi Everyone,

We have our March meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for networking,
talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff. For this month we have one of our
members, __Mitch Matuson__, giving a talk on:

__Controlling the Future through Observable Streams__

An introduction to asynchronous and event based programming with RxJS. You'll
see how you can control the complexity of asynchronous code in a concise and
expressive form that doesn't require you to manage state or nested callbacks.
You'll see how Observable streams provide a uniform interface for working with
callbacks, promises and events (like DOM inputs, web sockets, etc..). The
examples will be focused on UI programming in JavaScript, but the concepts are
applicable for both front-end and back-end developers in a variety of different
languages including Java, .Net and Python.

If you are looking for a simpler way to write asynchronous code, this talk is
for you!
