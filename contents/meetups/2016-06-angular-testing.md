Hi Everyone! We have our June meetup all ready to go! Join us at 6:30pm for
networking, talk starts at 7, all the normal stuff (pizza, drinks, etc). This
month we sent out a call to arms and got a lot of great responses.  Next up we
welcome __Jim Lynch__ as he gives us an introduction to unit testing with
Angular:

__Intro to Angular Automated Testing__

Are you an Angular developer who wants to start unit testing your applications,
but you just don't "get it"? In this talk Jim Lynch explains what tests are,
how to write them, and how to run them with Karma & Protractor in both Angular
1 and Angular 2 webapps!
