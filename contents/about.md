Bucks County JS is a group of professionals that are interested in, and
involved with development in the browser and beyond. We usually meet on the
first Wednesday of every month. Topics include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js,
build tools and automation, popular/upcoming frameworks and libraries, and
more!
